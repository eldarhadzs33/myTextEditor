# 🧠 C Text Editor Challenge 

Welcome to my repository for the **Text Editor Challenge** — where I build a simple text editor from scratch in **C**, using only terminal tools and raw input handling.

This is my personal learning project to:
- 🔍 Understand how terminal-based text editors work under the hood
- 🧠 Improve my knowledge of C programming
- ⚙️ Get better at using **Neovim** for real development work

---

## 📚 What This Is

I’m following the amazing [**kilo** tutorial by Daniel Holden](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) — a clean and minimal text editor built in under 1000 lines of C.

This challenge is about **learning by doing**, and I’ll post all my progress, experiments, and thoughts in this repo.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Learn terminal I/O, raw mode, and escape sequences
- ✅ Work with file buffers and memory safely in C
- ✅ Understand how simple editors render content, track cursors, and save files
- 🛠 Get more productive with **Neovim** by coding everything in it
- 🚀 Optional stretch goals: syntax highlighting, status bars, line numbers

---

## 🛠 Tools

- **Language:** C (C99 standard)
- **Editor:** Neovim 
- **Platform:** Linux (Terminal)
- **Tutorial base:** [kilo editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

## 🧵 Why I’m Doing This

I want to go beyond just writing high-level code — I want to understand how **editors**, **terminals**, and **raw input** actually work. This project is my dive into systems programming, C fundamentals, and better tooling with Neovim.
